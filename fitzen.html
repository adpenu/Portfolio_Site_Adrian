        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <p>As part of the UX Designer bootcamp by CareerFoundry, I was responsible with creating an app that would meet the general criterias and feature requirements.
            Alongside having a full-time job, the entire UX process took 8 months and revolves around the idea of helping users approach fitness and wellbeing from a holistic perspective.

        <h2>Context</h2>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <p>With over 8000 fitness apps available on the market it can cause users to feel overwhelmed by the multitude of choice.
            With more fitness oriented people than ever it’s crucial to create a product that it’s based around their personality,
            expectations and desires. According to <a href="https://comparecamp.com/fitness-statistics/" target="_blank">comparecamp.com</a> the main
            challenge is to keep users committed and motivated to achieve their goals.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <p>By adopting a holistic approach to our wellness app, we believe it will help users achieve their goals and adopt a health-conscious mindset in order to maintain the results.</p>
          <p> We expect to see an increase in engagements with the product and positive reviews.
          </p>

        <h3>UNDERSTAND</h3>
        <h2>Focusing on <span class="strikethrough">business</span> users</h2>

        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <p>Understanding user problems whilst also addressing the expectations of stakeholders and
            acknowledging the business scope are aspects to be taken in consideration when drawing
            up a plan to which all parties can adhere to.</p>

        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <h2>Target audience</h2>
          <p>The mindset of our target user is someone who understands the need for physical and mental improvement but is not sure where and how to start the journey.
            Another type of user could be someone who is already working on their well-being but would like to track their progress, access medical history or want to experiment with a new program.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <h2>Risk & opportunity</h2>
          <p>The main risk is that our service will not gain enough traction to stand out from the plethora of wellness apps that are currently available. .</p><br />
          <p>We can make the difference by creating an app that will guide and inform the user on the necessity of overall improvement in order to achieve maximum results.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <h2>Competition</h2>
          <p>Main competitors to our service would be the likes of Noom and MyFitnessPal.
            This is due to similar approach of helping the clients feel better and get in shape by tracking their diets and exercise routine.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <h2>Problem statement</h2>
          <p>Health-conscious people need a way to start their journey in fitness and stay on track with their well-being because it can be very difficult to find time and motivation in everyday life.
          </p><br />
          <p>We will know this to be true when we see users reaching their health goals.</p>

          <p>Also the study of Material Design Components helped me make the app in line with the requirements of the field and adhere to universal principles of design.

          <p>Choosing background images was the main struggle because of the contrast with the text so I have moved some of the information into the splash screen. I’ve also relied on A/B testing for the logo.

          <p>‘Dashboard’ screen is the main page of the app considered as a hub for the user.
            The idea was to design this page so it contains all the basic elements and keeps user engaged at the same time.
            In first instance I approached this issue by creating an interface consisting of cards with a vertical scroll.
            The feedback from user testing helped me understand the limitations and frictions that needed to be addressed.

          <p>‘Workouts’ will most likely be one of the more popular features amongst users. Simplicity and clarity were my main concerns in establishing concise content.
            Initially, cards with icons were selected for workout categories but decided in the end to use a more user friendly approach by adding relevant images to the cards.

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <p>The initial hypothesis of a holistic approach to fitness encouraging users to do better has come up during the qualitative research
            where users expressed the desire to see improvement in all aspects of their lives. Subsequently, a second hypothesis could be raised: users will generally see greater improvements if they journal their results and thoughts.
            I tried to keep these ideas in the forefront when creating the app so that they can be tested later on.
          </p>
        </div>
        <br />

        <h2>Learnings</h2>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <p>Going through each stage of the UXD process for my case study has taught me about the importance of having a user centred approach towards every project and keeping an open mind regarding the outcomes.
            I find usability testing to be the most important stage as it’s the best way to test a hypothesis and to discover frictions.

          </p>
        </div>
        <br />

        <h2>Whats's next?</h2>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <p>I would like to further test the high fidelity version of FitZEN to further refine the navigation and certain features. Performing tests and analysis after the app is launched as a MVP can also be a great opportunity to learn about the
            target audience and their needs.
            In the future I would also like to tackle the issue of child obesity and develop a feature in FitZEN that would work together with parents and their children.
