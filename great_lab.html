          <p>As a UX Designer with background in dental technology I am responsible for improving the user experience of our digital SaaS
            platform and dental products by combining customer
            insights, business analytics and design strategy. The role requires turning highly technical tools into user friendly layouts that
            increase efficiency and improve navigation.</p>
            <br/>
            <p> I work cross-functionally with Product Manager, Dental team, UI Designers and Engineers
              to drive direction and vision for our product across the dental
              industry.

        <h3>CHALLENGES </h3>
        <h2>#1 A new approach</h2>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <p>Generally the dentists are complacent with the status quo of having to work with several labs to deliver their work. Also they are lacking time for learning how to use new tools and platforms.
            Most of them are working tight shifts and are self-employed so the amount of time spent on learning new concepts is limited.
            This requires us to invest even more effort in making the user experience as seamless and intuitive as possible.
          </p>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <h2>#2 Creating a lean system</h2>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <p>Orthodontic treatment with clear aligners was initially the only product that we offered. It was meant to test the water and see if the concept of digital lab would work.
            With it catching on fast we started planning the expansion of the system to integrate other branches of dentistry: prosthetics, restorations and implants.
            We soon came to realise the technicality and complexity of the task ahead.

        <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT </h3>
        <h2>Defining the issue</h2>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <p>We believe dental surgeries need our unified digital system for improving treatment planning and for time management.</p><br />
           <p> We will know this to be true when there's a high satisfaction rate amongst dentists which will lead to increase in orders.

        <h2>Usability is key</h2>
        <a name="observations"></a>

        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <p>Before jumping to the challenge of designing a fully integrated dental system I wanted to evaluate the usability of the current MVP. As mentioned it included only orthodontic treatment.
             I approached it as the foundation for the work that was to come. Being able to setup an account and create a patient order were the basics that we needed to get right.

          <h4>Observation #1 - Fluid navigation</h4>
          <p>I suggested adding a filter option such as order type, time/duration, stage of completion and clinic name. </p><br />
          <p>Also a search bar for quick finding of a specific case, patient or surgery name. This would mean the ‘Orders’ menu would be incorporated in the Dashboard.</p><br />
          <p>Alternatively, we could make the Dashboard more focused on analytics and tracking.</p>

          <h4>Observation #2 - Improved accessibility</h4>
          <p>Being a SaaS platform it's important to ask questions of accesibility and usability: Will the dentist fill in a digital lab form before sending scans to us? </p><br />
          <p>If yes then would those details be uploaded automatically to this portal?</p><br />
          <p>Do dentists have access to an individual dashboard where they can add orders, track cases and make requests/ updates?</p>

        <div class="flexbox-item flexbox-item4">
          <h4>Observation #3 - Understanding the user</h4>
          <p> The most important things dentist care about is speed and precision (and price). We should setup a system in which they can confirm a treatment plan as soon 
            as it's issued by the technician which will automatically send it to production stage. Also the presentation of the treatment plan has to be exhaustive yet easy to grasp </p><br />

        <h3>THE FRAMEWORK</h3>
        <h2>Structuring the experience</h2>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <p>Before jumping to the challenge of designing a fully integrated dental system I wanted to evaluate the usability of the current MVP. As mentioned it included only orthodontic treatment.
            I approached it as a foundational framework for the platform. Being able to setup an account and create a patient order were the basics that we needed to get right. 
         </p>
         
         <br/>
         <p>Due to the industry-specific nature of the software and with new clients joining every week the time spent on training and subsequent costs had to be kept in check.
           The balancing act between learnability and efficiency had to be achieved.</p>
          <div class="diagram">

          <p>Circular representation of usability components and their deliverables.</p>
        </div>

         <br/>
         <p>The steepness of the learning curve and the efficiency of interaction would indicate how high is the productivity that users can reach once they've fully
          learned how to use the product. Implementing shortcuts seemed the most viable solution for carefully balancing learnability and efficiency.</p>

          <p>Learning curve and the efficiency of shortcuts in the ordering flow.</p>
        </div>
          <br/>
         <p> Dentists have their own preferences and 
          specific way of working so we decided to compile a 'best practices' report for each client and use it as a shortcut during the ordering phase.
           This will save them time by avoiding repetititve actions. 
          Alternatively they will have the option of customising a case if they wish.

          <h2>Meeting user needs</h2>
          <div class="flexbox-item">
            <p>After discussing with our customer support team we found out that dentists often relied on support because they felt unsure whilst placing an order.
              We prioritised fixing the issue as it was hindering the user experience and the quality of the work.
            </p> <br />
          <p>The progress bar feature was designed to offer more context by letting the users know where they are in completing a certain action. It also helps with learnability 
           and memorability. We decided to try and integrate it in all our flows as a form of gamification and to minimize cognitive load.</p>

      <p>Another concern was to offer users the possibility to place different type of products within the same order. Currently the software allows dentists to checkout 
        multiple products but only if they're the same type of restoration and made of the same material (ie. metal, zirconia, etc.).

          <p>Taking a top-down approach to defining the overall framework of the experience required higher emphasis on planning and understanding how the new features will affect the system as a whole. </p>
          <br/>
          <p>I generated stacks of ideas about the arrangement of UI, functional and data elements, and interactive behaviours. Starting broad, our vision began evolving into something tangible. 
            A high‐level design language, interactions and minimalistic composition began to piece together. </p>

            <p>Before moving to the design stage the developers suggested to map out the ordering system

          <p>The next hurddle was to turn these highly technical road maps into user friendly layouts that
            increase efficiency and improve navigation. Creating the blueprint allowed us to find patterns that can help devise workable solutions around every single piece of functionalty. </p>

             <p>Understanding the usage contexts of the platform helped me develop a clear vision of the tonal expectations of our users. To communicate the personality of our app to our client and team,
             we developed a set of experience principles. These were used to sense‐check design decisions, articulate core values and describe key attributes the product should uphold for both the users and the brand.
             The principles were used constantly to drive the aesthetic, feel and overall tonal direction of the app.</p>

            <p>Constant communication between departments has been pivotal in maintaing the vision and tone of our product throughout the design process. 
              The deliverables for the clear aligner orders have been sent to the UI designers to refine the interface by adhering to our design system library.

        <h3>INSIGHTS</h3>
        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <div class="flexbox-item">
          <p>These changes have improved the quality of service and there has been an increase in orders in the final quarter of 2022. The product that was in place before I 
            joined the team was unidimensional and rigid. By demanding high standards from ourselves and the work produced we want to create a culture that seeks to earn 
            trust through accountability, attention to detail and continuous improvement.</p><br/>

            <p>The approach of the company is for incremental developement of the SaaS platform based on research and feasibility. Besides delivering high quality
            dental restorations the company has to equally focus on the digital product that it's offering to customers. This challenge is not something that
            traditional dental labs have to deal with and is revolutionising the industry.
          </p>
</div>
<br/>
<h2>What's next</h2>
<div class="flexbox-item">
  <p>Improving the navigation and interface elements are an ongoing process. We learn from feedback and usability testing so we can further reiterate and minimise frictions.
     Now that we have a solid framework to build upon we can focus on developing the restorative and implant based systems on the platform. A unified internal system for communication between technicians and dentists is also in the works.
